# robotrike-eecs51

Project for EE/CS 51 at Caltech, implementing the assembly code to control and operate a 3-wheeled robot (robotrike).

You may not look at any code in this repository if you are currently enrolled in or may take EE/CS 51 in the future, as that will be a violation of the Caltech honor code.
