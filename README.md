# robotrike-eecs51

Project for EE/CS 51 (Fall 2015) at Caltech, implementing the assembly code to control and operate a 3-wheeled robot (robotrike). All done in the Intel 80188 microprocessor architecture.

You may not look at any code in this repository if you are currently enrolled in or may take EE/CS 51 in the future, as that will be a violation of the Caltech honor code.
